# Angular-Triva-App

An app built with Angular and Angular Material. It uses Google Authentication to sign in and create and account. It's meant to be played locally on one computer.
You can add players that have also signed in to the game and select different criteria for the game. The application pulls questions from an API based on the parameters the user selects. After a game is completed it saves the information to a Firebase collection, which is used throughout the app to update player information based on their performance and renders on a Player Details page.
